## Drinking Rules

Alcohol is consumed by many cultures across nearly every Dungeons and Dragons setting. The following is a ruleset meant to cover drinking more extensively than a binary “you’re drunk” Constitution saving throw.

There are five states of inebriation, ranging from Sober to Wasted. These states of inebriation and their effects are described in the table below.

| _State_ | _Cumulative_ _Effect_                                                |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sober   | -                                                                    |
| Buzzed  | Advantage on social checks, disadvantage on all other ability checks |
| Tipsy   | Unable to move more than 10 feet in a straight line.                 |
| Drunk   | Disadvantage on all checks, attack rolls, and saving throws.         |
| Wasted  | Unconscious for 2d4 hours.                                           | 

The disadvantage from being Drunk overrides the benefits of being Buzzed.

Each time a drink is consumed, the player rolls a d10. The result of this roll is added to a player’s **Drink Tally**.

The interval between two states of inebriation equals a character’s constitution modifier, with a minimum of one. 

_Example: +3 constitution modifier_

| _State_ | _Drink Tally_ |
| ------- | ------------- |
| Sober   | Always 10     |
| Buzzed  | 13            |
| Tipsy   | 16            |
| Drunk   | 19            |
| Wasted  | 22            |
A character proficient in Constitution saving throws may choose to reduce the result of a drink roll by their proficiency bonus.

  

A character resistant to the effects of poison, such as a Dwarf with Dwarven Resilience, may roll a drink twice and take the most advantageous result.

For example, Flagon the dwarf decides to imbibe some drink to weather the nobleman’s ball. His intention is to get Buzzed; his constitution modifier is +3, and he is proficient in constitution saving throws. This means his Drink Tally must be between 13 and 15 to be buzzed.

On his first drink, Flagon rolls a 6 and a 10. As drink is not free, he decides to choose the 10, to get drunk faster.

On his second drink, Flagon rolls a 7 and a 3. He picks the 7 and chooses to reduce it by his proficiency bonus, which is 2.

This takes his Drink Tally to 15, which is his maximum Drink Tally for being Buzzed.

At the ball, however, a situation forces him to have one more drink, and social custom does not allow him to refuse.

Flagon rolls one more time, and rolls a 10 and a 9. He futilely picks the 9 and reduces it by 2. Unfortunately for him, that still leaves his Drink Tally at 22, and he passes out for 3 hours.
