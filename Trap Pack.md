# Trap Pack
**Trigger**: the DM uses 5e traps as written

**Effect**: Players must save or suffer boredom and frustration.

## Introduction
Traps are a staple of the fantasy genre. The great mythic heroes of old often overcame obstacles through wit and guile, instead of brute strength (even Hercules, the strongest man in the world, cleaned the Augean Stables not by brute force but by redirecting a river. Obviously, his clever player wasn't keen to roll 14 Clear Manure checks!).

As Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) is a roleplaying game in the fantasy genre, players expect traps.[^1] They are a cornerstone of the exploration pillar of gameplay, a pillar that is sadly (and ironically) underexplored in modern gaming.  

At the table however, they are not always as intuitive for a Dungeon Master (DM) to run as say a combat encounter. Combat encounters are dynamic, exciting and filled with meaningful choices. A stereotypical trap encounter is often the opposite.

**The Stereotypical trap encounter** (The three D's) ^1d1089

-   **Detection** - DM asks for a Wisdom (Perception) check.
-   **Disarm** - If spotted; Rogue rolls a Dexterity(Thieves' Tools) check to disarm the trap.
-   If not spotted or if the Rogue's check fails, players roll a saving throw.
-   **Damage** - Depending on the saving throw, DM rolls damage and the players record it on their character sheets.

Yikes. Not only did the trap tax the parties resources, it did it in a way that did not involve a single player choice! The DM could resolve this entire encounter without the input of the players if they had the relevant stats.

Actually, we should steelman our argument a bit. Players made choices at character creation, when they invested in characters proficient in Perception or with Thieves' Tools! However, as we already stated, traps are a foundational part of D&D, and so players will <u>always</u> make sure they have someone able to deal with traps. A resource that you are obligated to pay is a tax! Imagine if players could choose if they wanted hit points (HP) or not! Instead, since combat is a foundational pillar of the game, every character gets HP. Some characters just get less or more depending on their choice of class or their Constitution score. ^c5a546

Similarly, traps should not just be something only for the Rogue player. Every character has the Wisdom stat and all players have the required agency to deal with traps, skilled Rogues and perceptive elves are just a little better equipped.

## The way too esoteric definition of a trap…

… follows from the structure of a role playing game!

All roleplaying games operate according to the same basic form; a quasi-structural conversation:

1.  The DM describes the environment
2.  The players imagine themselves in that environment as if it was a real place and describe the actions their characters take.
3.  The DM adjudicates how the players action have altered the environment and then describes the new environment.

Repeat ad infinitum. In practise, this proces is usually an incredible mess with vagueries and blurry borders and Monthy Python jokes. But that is what it boils down to. As with all messy processes, good DM's quickly learn some good principles to navigate them, such as:

-   **Repeat yourself often** -  Short term memory rarely holds information longer then 20 seconds. Because your players are human, it is ok to continuously remind them of things that their characters can clearly observe.

>*Player*: "All our waterskins are empty? Come on guys, we need to fill the Nymphs basin to learn the location of the fabled sword!"
>
>*DM*: Remember that it is raining hard right now.
>
>*Player*: "Oh yeah I forgot. We fill our waterskins in some rain puddles and…"

-   **The deadly difference** - When players take actions that seem nonsensical to you, there has often been a misunderstanding on either your or their side. Therefore, good DM's often make sure that players have an approximate idea of possible consequences, and an approximate idea of their odds. ^b63e2e

>*Player*: "I jump over the ravine."
>
>*DM*: "It's 50 feet to the other side, there is no way your character can jump that. It's 30 feet deep, so 6d6 bludgeoning damage if you fall. Sure you want to do that?"
>
>*Player*: "Oh, I thought it was only 10 feet wide! I'll cast fly on myself then."

-   **Default to yes**: In a traditional game, you can only do what the rules tell you you can do. In a roleplaying game, unless the rules tell you that you cannot do it, you might very well be able to do it (or atleast try!). Therefore, "No" is a very stagnating answer, so it is good practice to keep improv-theather tips in mind and default to yes as much as you can. After all, when a player says they want to do X, that usually implies that they think X is fun for them. This applies to information to; don't hide it behind rolls, when in doubt default in favor of the players and give them the information.
-   **Assume competency**: The characters are savvy adventurers, even when the players are not. When in doubt about competency, rule in favor of the players. Assume the characters are paying attention, are focused and as swift and efficient as they can be without risking mistakes. Unless there is an authentic reason for them being distracted (character is sleeping etc) it is courteous to assume they are vigilant. This builds trust between you and your players (and saddles them with the responsibility when they fuck up instead of malicious narration by the DM!).

>*Player*: "I take out my Thieves' Tools and pick the lock on the chest."
>
>DM: "Yeah, there is no time pressure here. You fiddle around for a few minutes and unlock the chest. Inside you find…"

When characters toss knives in a battle, assume they pick them back up again afterwards. Assume characters equipment is always in the best state and well maintained. If they pass a pond with clear water, assume their characters refilled their waterskins. These are all 'non-decisions'; as in: the cost for taking them is so low and their benefit so high that it is unreasonable to expect players to not take them. Err on the side of competency.

(Asshole DM: "Haha, you didn't say your character was breathing, everyone roll a Constitution Saving throw!")

Returning to traps, a good benchmark is noting if your players say things like "I carefully approach" or "I pay very good attention." a lot. These approaches often have no or little significant cost in D&D, so they are a sign that your players are not trusting you to make these non-decisions for them (or perhaps they were abused by a previous DM that often pulled these gotcha's on them if they did not explicitly say them). If this is the case, reassure them calmly and consistently that you are always assuming best effort from their characters.

-   **Repeat yourself often**
-   **No, but** -  The very last defense before you encounter the icky "No". Offering alternatives to players so that they can still achieve what they want their character to achieve within the reality of the game world.

>*Player*: "I go to this towns wizard academy!"
>
>*DM*: "Unfortunately, there is no wizard academy in this town. You might want to visit the arcane university though, that is 2 weeks travel north of here."
>
-   **Repeat yourself often**

As you can see, a lot of these principles come down to clear communication!

A trap however, is the one time you as a Dungeon Master are allowed to be intentionally vague in presenting information (step 1), so that a superficial interpretation of the info will conclude something about the game world that is actually false, while thinking deeply about the info will likely reveal the true nature of the game world. In short, <u>traps deal with authentic misinformation in the game world</u> (not misinformation in our world, that should be avoided by the principles above)

If the consequences of this bamboozle are negative, we speak of a trap encounter. If they are neutral or positive, the term trick encounter is more appropriate. (Examples of tricks include secret doors and hidden treasure).

This representation is a semi-breach of the social contract you have with your players. This is very icky territory! It is therefore important to limit yourself and hold yourself to some rules before you get them with the gotcha!

-   It is clear that you are in an area where traps can happen. This is called telegraphing the trap.
-   In the fiction, you pass a threshhold into the underworld. Here, you have heard that the kobolds defend their lair with devious traps!
-   In the room, you see a burnt corpse of an unlucky adventurer. Best watch out for flamy traps!
-   In the Tomb of Horrors, every trap is telegraphed because everything is a trap.
-   There is SOME hint that an attentive player can pick up on. <u>It is verboten to give **no** information</u>. The information needn't be obvious though. You can confuscate it through subtlety or by hiding it between lots of other irrelevant pieces of information:
	>-   *WRONG DM*:"You see 3 trolls running towards you!"
	*Attentive Player*: "We use fire!"
	*DM*: "Nope. HAHA these trolls were immune to fire!"
	>(note how the DM gave no indication these trolls were exceptional)
	>
	>-   RIGHT DM:"You see 3 trolls running towards you. They are glowing orange and their footsteps leave steam!
	>	*Inattentive Player*: \* looks up from phone \*. "Trolls huh? I cast fireball at 9th level."
	>	*Attentive Player*: "Wait, I think these might be special trolls who are immune. Try ice!"
	>	*DM*: "Very savy of you! The firebrand trolls shatter in a thousand pieces, unable to regenerate their fiery flesh!"

When you have a conclusion that you really want players to make, tell them. If you really want your players to make the conclusion themselves, include at least three clues.[^12] For example, if you want to hint at an invisible wall being over an open pit:

-   Include a note in another room about a wizard experimenting with invisibility
-   The 'pit' underneath the wall is not a pit, but the floor collapsed under the weight of the wall.
-   Rubble in the collapse shows square indents, as if someone pressed bricks in them and then pulled them back out. These are in fact the indentations of some of the invisible bricks which fell down from the wall in the collapse.

## Goals for handling traps

Let's formulate some goals about the way we are going to handle traps:

1.  A good trap can be 'solved' completely through player skill. To make sure every character has ability to participate, resolving traps is handled as much as possible through this player skill rather than character skill. (Again, think of combat; every character has different in-game abilities, but the players get to make choices on how they use their abilities in a fight. The character has the skill to wield a longsword; but the player decides who he wields it against).
2.  No meaningful choice means there is no encounter. We will try to maximize interaction and choice (remember, rolling a die is not a choice, it is the real world action that comes *after* a meaningful choice).
3.  Always give some kind of information. The information needn't be obvious, but enough so a savvy player can draw reasonable conclusions.

## Research
Before we get to work; let's completely go counter to our goals and resolve traps fully abstract;

>*DM*: Ok, so this dungeon is riddled with traps. As you move from room to room, someone in the party will have to make a Wisdom (Investigation) check every time. On a failure, the whole party rolls a Dexterity Save to halve 1d6 damage, ok?
>
>*Party*: Got it, so basically, finding the shortest path and avoiding backtracking is how we have the best chance to avoid the damage tax?
>
>*DM*: Yeah basically. So, you guys are in a 20x20 feet room and…

There is nothing wrong with this approach. It resembles lifestyle expenses in town; we just assume that you spend less on some days, more on others, but we don't care about the nitty gritty, just pay X every day you are in town. We are doing the same here, we assume the party is carefully checking for traps, accidentally triggering some etc so that they might have a little less resources in between encounters.

It recognizes the tedium from the stereotypical example above and just abstracts it away into a distilled procedure that takes at most 60 seconds. The core engagement is more on the macro-scale of the dungeon itself; "We've found a clue that indicates good loot in that room, but we'll have to make 5 checks vs traps to backtrack to it and our Fighter is low on HP. Do we take the risk? Spend a spell slot to heal the Fighter? Spend a spell slot to buff the Rogue's Perception?..."

However, I assume many players and DM's will find this approach inherently unsatisfying. In a roleplaying game you should in fact, play your role[^2] and be immersed in the situation. Poking and prodding and interacting with the trap as if you were there.

Let's see if we can take the stereotypical example and inject some choice in there shall we!

## The problems (according to the [[Trap Pack#^1d1089|3 D's]])

### Detection
It might seem simple, but this first step will prove a whole beast to tackle!

You knew it was coming, let's talk about metagaming. There are two kinds of players, those who say they can roleplay without metagaming and those who tell the truth. It is, almost by definition, impossible for humans to act as if they don't have a piece of knowledge when they do, in fact, have that knowledge. How do you know how an ignorant PC would have acted? This question has no right answer, only miserable discussion. It is discussing an alternate universe, except in the least fun way possible in a tabletop roleplaying game. The only way to irrefutably 'prove' to a stuck-up DM that you are not metagaming is activating the failstate. The 'reward' players get for holding on to this backwards ideology is risking possible death, the default loss condition in most games.  
(BTW; these metagaming discussions are living proof that breaching the social contract, even when said contract is unspoken, is not something to be treated lightly.)

#### A sad tale

Anyway, the DM decides that they don't want to be arbitrary in determining wether or not the PC sees the trap. Rocks fall, everyone dies is bad sport in a collaborative game.

So, the DM asks for Perception checks.  
First of all, on a table with 5 players, even without any bonuses, the average of this roll is 17. There is only a 17% chance no one rolls lower than a 15. But the DM doesn't want the noticing to be automatic (rocks fall, no one dies?), they just want it to be viable.

So the DM only asks one person, perhaps the scout or rogue or closest PC to make a check. If it's good they spot it. If it's bad, they know they missed something (After all, why would the DM ask for the check if there was nothing to see?). Queue the other players "Can I try?", "Yeah, I'll take a look as well", "Me too! I have Darkvision.". In other words, unless the DM finds some convoluted reason why the party only has one collective pair of eyes active at a time, constantly switching between them, we're right back at rocks fall, no one dies.

So our poor DM adds in false perception checks, asking for them even when there is nothing to be found. After 20 or so rooms without negative concequences on low checks, the party relaxes with the metagaming (right up until they activate a trap of course; we'll discuss paranoia later). Only, they have now sacrificed the most valuable resource; time at the table. As well as the second most valuable resource, immersion. Every room entered pulls the players out of the game world into the real world, where they can roll their perception tax every time before they're allowed to interact with the content of each room.[^3] Lo and behold, Perception is now the most rolled skill, and the PC dutifully spend points on it with every character they create in your campaigns from now on, even when it means forgoing another skill that they really liked (remember, a resource that you are obligated to pay is called a [[Trap Pack#^c5a546|tax]]). Hours of time that could be spent happily gaming ticks away under the iron ideology of metagaming. 

F. 

We can see that the perception skill is problematic because it interacts with the important first step in the structure of roleplaying games (the DM describes the situation), the step which is the foundation for the following two steps in the pattern (were the actual interacting happens!).

But this foolish ideology is actually a tyrant, and tyrants don't stop when people are annoyed, they want *miserable* gamers. And like real life tyrants, the strategies don't actually work. Because if the players still know whether they rolled high or low, they can still metagame! "Let's skip this room guys, we rolled low on our checks."

So this DM (if they didn't go insane by now) rolls for the players behind the screen. Downsides are legion: the DM needs to keep track of their bonuses (if only we had some kind of sheet for that!), there is more cognitive strain on the DM, the players lose a sense of ownership (the odds don't change, but fun is subjective: if something feels fun, it IS fun. Someone else rolling a dice for you does not feel as fun as doing it yourself), players don't know when to spend mulligans (for example Luck points), and the DM needs to spent so much time rolling these damn things (remember, according to their logic, they can't do it only when relevant or the players will MeTagAmE!). It's a mess.

Even game designers knew it was a mess, and passive perception was born. Now no-one had to roll futile dice and you had an exact threshold to tell you what is noticed, still based on character expertise too! The DM still had to track modifiers, but it was a one time deal. Comparing two numbers also takes very little time and cognitive effort. It seems like a win all around! Except…

Except there was absolutely no randomness now. In a published product, this works, because designers set the difficulty class (DC) without knowing what the parties passive perception will be. Agency retained. But the DM in a homebrew game does know, and can set the DC's for traps however they like. We're right back at the beginning, with DM's arbitrarily deciding whether or not you notice something! Rocks fall and I'll decide who dies!

#### Searching & Paranoia
In the fictional universe of D&D, it makes sense that characters will not have to rely on passive observation alone. Players in good faith who don't want to metagame but also want their characters to live can say their characters are carefully searching a room. Because the actions the party takes are most likely exhaustive and repetitive (and therefore a slog to describe every time), the DM can then abstract away their search and narrate if they find anything. If this search is resolved by roll the same problems from above might show up, only in lesser degree.  
Game designer Soren Johnson once said; given the opportunity, players will optimize the fun out of a game.[^4] This applies here as well; players will diligently say 'I search the room' when they enter a new place (or failed a previous search) every single time. It is a boring ritual that must to be undertaken repeatedly in order to interact with the content. In most new school games there is no cost for searching, so this is technically one of those 'non-decisions' we discussed at the start that should be assumed. In order to make searching a genuine choice; it must have some kind of consequence attached. This consequence should be severe enough so that is is not viable to search every room, but not so severe that the party will never search. In older editions, this consequence was the wandering monster check every time the party spent a turn searching. DM's who wish to eschew wandering monsters checks would do well to think of some kind of consequence, perhaps setting of the trap on a failed check (even though this is a less than ideal solution, but it is the only meaningful penalty in games where hit points and spell slots are the only resources that matter).

#### Fixing Detection
**Easiest fix**: Ditch detection. Seriously. Skip straight to obvious.
-   Swinging blades are in this hallway. How do we get past it?
-   A pit trap with spikes on the bottom blocks your path. Only Strength 15+ may jump it. How do we get past it?
-   Metal nozzles come out of the gargoyle's mouths. The stonework is burnt black and smells of ash. Surely, these will activate when you enter the hall. How do we get past it?
-   Stone faces look upon this hallway, and broken darts lie all around. How do we get past it?
-   Bronze pipe are slowly filling this room with poison gas. The door is closing. What do we do?
-   A pit blocks your path. It is filled with poison snakes. How do we get past it?

This approach skips straight to the most interesting part of a trap (dealing with it) and makes it unnecessary to break the social contract. According to our [[Trap Pack#The way too esoteric definition of a trap…|definition]], It is no longer a trap encounter (because there is no bamboozle in the DM's description), even though in the fiction the characters are encountering an actual trap.

**New school x old school fix (middle aged school?)**:
First, in order to fix paranoia, make sure that:
-   You assume competency.
-   Traps are only in locations that make sense.

These will prevent players from searching well traveled rooms for traps, but make them wary in dusty hallways filled with spiderwebs that the kobolds seem to avoid. Some kind of internal consistency or logic in the traps makes sure that players can have some 'Dungeon Mastery', as in literally knowing the workings of the dungeon ("We should avoid this room, all statues with a shield in their left hand have attacked us so far and this room is filled with them!"). This makes traps more like a puzzle on the macro scale.

Second, to fix the Perception conundrum, consider this solution: instead of having the players roll Wisdom (Perception), roll a Dexterity (Stealth) check behind the screen for the trap and compare it to the passive perception scores of the players.

Trap|Bonus to roll
:---:|:---:
Easy trap|+2 or +3 Stealth
Medium trap|+4 to +7 Stealth
Hard trap | +8 to +12 Stealth

If the trap 'fails' the check, narrate one subtle sign of the presence of a trap and one very obvious sign of it's presence. If it succeeds, only narrate the subtle sign (goal 3, always give some kind of information).

Examples of subtle signs: Burn marks, holes in the wall, slits in the wall,

Examples of obvious signs: Pressure plate, tripwire, outline of pit.

If the party searches, reveal both the subtle and obvious signs of the trap and apply the chosen consequence of searching.

TIP: When describing the results of the search, let the players make a conclusion themselves instead of simply describing the solution. "Yeah there is a pit trap there" is not as engaging as "you see the subtle outline of a square loose flagstone without mortar". The last description is enough to inform gamers that something is fishy, but they had to make that final leap of logic themselves.[^5]

This approach fixes a whole slew of problems. First, assuming competency means the perception dance™ is no more, players know that they will always at least get something, regardless of rolls. It is however still based on character expertise, as characters with high passive perception have a much higher chance of noticing the obvious signs. The DM only has to make one roll, and only when there is a trap. All player facing mechanics can remain, the traps stealth bonus is DM facing. It also involves some player skill, because players have to pay attention to description and think a little about the game world. They will search only in strategic locations instead of always.

Savy DM's will note there is still some trace of metagaming here; because the players will notice the DM roll the dice!

-   This is less of a problem than you might think. Most DM's roll dice behind the screen for many reasons, and the players don't really know what the roll was for (unlike the player facing perception checks). It might make players a wary, but only a little. Because dealing with the trap is the actual gameplay, having a hunch is actually a feature here, not a bug (remember, the first solution we proposed was to just ditch detection all together to get to the fun stuff faster). Perhaps the players wariness represents some sort of sixth sense on the characters part. You saw the DM roll a dice and he described an inconspicuous room, but it is quiet. Too quiet. What does your character do?
-   If the DM is still worried, they may roll with a digital dice roller or roll an arbitrary amount of time before players are in the room. It should at least be a lot more expedient as it is only a single dice roll. The DM can also just chuck a die anytime he wants the party to be suspicious.

### Disarming
When you were reading the examples from the easy fix above, what was your brain doing? Perhaps it was already thinking of clever solutions to get past the trap.

Emphasizing player skill in how your players bypass the trap is vital. This means that it is possible for players to get past the trap without any sort of cost, IF they make clever decisions!

Do not have the kneejerk reflex to think that this means players are "skipping" content. <u>A trap encounter hasn't "failed" when the trap didn't go off</u>. It took you 10 seconds to look up how much damage this trap should do, and you get a good 10 minutes of play time out of it. Say yes to their clever thinking, because;

-   They are interacting with the world as if it was a real place and genuinly giving something in your world some thought (roleplaying & immersion are the real win).
-   Trivializing a challenge by taking clever action is half the fun of good D&D.[^6] In this game, they may finally be free of the unskippable cutscene or the invisible wall.

It doesn't have to be particularly complex. A basic presentation that is easy to visualize is perfect. It should invite an immediate practical approach. As long as your players are thinking, they are having fun.

For more challenge, it is usually trivial to combine several simple traps together to give your players a real braincracker.

#### Fixing Disarming
To make sure the Rogue with Thieves' Tools is the go-to guy in every situation, have them be able to make a Thieves' Tools check to disable any trap.

**Old school games** -  A roll can be made to disable a trap with Thieves Tools. On a succes, the trap is disabled. On a failure, it will take a turn to disable the trap. If the characters do not wish to wait a full turn to disable, they can opt to do a rushed job. To do a rushed job, the players rolls their check again. On a succes, the trap is disabled. On a failure, the trap goes of instead. Players should be informed of any consequences throughout this interaction. The disabling of a trap with Thieves Tools is a failsafe; the first option of the party should be disabling traps by clever player skill.

**New school games** (without turns and random encounters) - If player ingenuity fails for whatever reason, a trap may be disabled using Thieves Tools. On a failed check, the trap will go off. Inform the players of this beforehand (remember, [[Trap Pack#^b63e2e|the deadly difference]]. When in doubt, give more information instead of less).

### Damage
The more dangerous something is, the more obvious it should be. The more subtle the trap, the less damage it should deal. Ideally, a skilled player (not character) who runs through the dungeon should come out the other end having taken less damage then an unskilled player. "Skilled" here means thinking about the game world as if it was a real place and taking it seriously. If "let the barbarian run through it and trigger all the traps" is a viable strategy, likely the punishment is not severe enough. In combat encounters, characters risk death, there is no reason it should be different for trap encounters. Characters should be able to take the damage from a trap maybe twice, or three times if they're beefy, before they collapse under their mistakes. And it has to be their mistake, do not let these guidelines fool you into thinking that trap encounters are only successful when they kill a character. A good trap should have the player saying "Yeah, I kinda figured that would happen" afterwards.

A fun and often forgotten rule from older editions to consider are unreliable triggers.[^7] For example, perhaps a pit trap only has a 2 in 6 chance of triggering when someone walks over it (1 in 6 for Small creatures!). In this way, a trap might not even trigger the first time characters pass it, but still become relevant when they later pass over an area they had considered already safe! It also makes sure that it is not always the character walking in front that falls victim to the trap. Surely, not every trap should have unreliable triggers, but consider this an extra tool in your toolbox when designing scenarios.

Saving throws are a thing in old school D&D that is often misunderstood by newer gamers. The fabled save vs death is surely the most known. It is correct to say "there is nothing fun about rolling a die to see if you live or die, that just random chance, not skill!". And this is correct. The saving throw is a failsafe mechanism built in to protect incompetent gamers. If you are rolling a saving throw, you should have already been dead and the game master is courteous enough to give you a chance to avoid this fate. This is the correct way to think about saving throws. Yes, the medusa can make you save or turn into stone. But a skilled party would never find themselves in a situation where they have to fight a medusa unprepared (unless they are playing with a wangrod DM who makes it rain medusa's by fiat, but that problem lies outside of the game).

Yet, it doesn't matter that you made the decision that led to a saving throw, it still feels like a "roll to not get screwed" moment. Even here, we can inject some player agency back in the process by using the the Angry GM's famous click-rule.[^8]

#### Click-rule
Whenever a player triggers a trap, tell them they hear a click (or some other perceivable sign that a trap has gone off) and ask them what they do. They must immediately say what their character does. Based on their answer, you may apply advantage or disadvantage or neither to the saving throw. If they fail to produce a response in time (remember, this represents a lightning quick reaction on the part of the character!) just let them make a regular saving throw.

Perhaps these guidelines can aid you in adjudicating the effects of their reaction, it also includes an optional table for lingering conditions following from a saving throw that failed by 5 or more:[^9]

![[trap-chart.png]]

This rule in no way removes the saving throw, but again gives advantage to cautious and attentive players. If players have a hunch how a trap works, they will likely get advantage on this save (they might lay down on the floor when they suspect that darts will be flying for example) because of their own player input.

### To summarise

#### Detection
Consider straight up making all traps automatically noticable. Alternatively, give a subtle hint and, if the trap fails a stealth roll against the parties highest passive perception, an obvious hint as well. Apply a consequence for exhaustive searching, for example a random encounter check or accidentally setting off the trap. Assume competence and vigilance from the characters.

#### Disarming 
A trap that did not injure a player character is not a failed trap encounter, but a successful one! Taking clever action to trivialize a challenge is half the fun of good D&D. Players engaging with the gameworld diegetically is immersive and fun, so give players the benefit of the doubt when adjudicating their approach to handling the trap. Use character skill such as a Rogue with Thieves tools as a fallback and apply an appropriate consequence such as with Detection.

#### Damage
When setting of the trap, ask the victim for their immediate reaction and apply advantage, disadvantage or other appropriate modifiers to their saving throw. Damage dealt is inversely proportional to how obvious the trap was. Do not make trap damage trivial, make it impactful enough so that a player can be careless exactly once.

## Addendum: Constructing traps
Traps have some kind of trigger and an effect that happens when the trigger goes off. Specific combinations of hidden/known triggers and effects might evoke different emotions.

- **Hidden trigger, hidden effect** -  Violates goal 3. BAD!
- **Known trigger, known effect** -  Emotion: Empowerment - "This gelatinous cube won't know what hit him when he blubbers over this pit trap!"
- **Hidden trigger, known effect** -  Emotion: Suspense, tension - "These stone statues are a bit too lifelike. Thread with caution!"
- **Known trigger, hidden effect** - Emotion: Curiosity, mystery. - "Hey, this statue can be rotated! I wonder what will happen?"
- **Crouching tiger, hidden dragon** - Emotion: Kung-Fu, skadoosh!

### Musings:
>A good trap should threaten a high-level PC, but can be solved by a 1st level one.[^10]

### Example Traps:

#### Bottomless pit with a twist[^11]
> - The party approaches a **bottomless pit**, too wide to jump.
> - A **stone beam** bridges the gap.
> - A **pungent smell of flammable fumes** rises from the depths.

>**Stealth +5 vs Passive Perception**
>If the trap <font color = green>succeeds</font>, the party notices a small gap between the beam and the floor.
>If the trap <font color = red>fails</font>, the party notices a small gap between the beam and the floor, and a subtle shine of metal reflecting their light.

**DM's Notes**
- The beam is actually a **swivel**, and anchored around and axis instead of solid. This makes it very unstable to cross, especially for those who don't know the beam might move!
- At the point where the beam connects to the floor, at both sides of the pit, are **two metal plates** pushing against each other. If the swivel rotates, the plates will grind against one another and produce a spark, which ignites the flammable fumes!

Crossing the pit requires a <u>DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check</u> (DC 8 if a creature is aware the beam might pivot). A creature has advantage on this check if it lies prone or balances itself using a long item (for example, a 10' pole or a spear). If the beam is somehow stabilized, the check automatically succeeds.

**Click-rule**
On a <font color = red>failure</font>, the creature notices itself falling. Immediately ask for it's reaction and then adjudicate the <u>DC 13 Dexterity saving throw</u> accordingly.
- If this save <font color = red>fails</font>, the creature falls into the bottomless pit. It is effectively dead and its body cannot be recovered.
- If this save <font color = green>succeeds</font>, the creature manages to hold on to the beam, but it will usually rotate. If it does, this will also trigger the metal plates to **produce sparks**, igniting the fumes!

If the metal plates **produce sparks**, again ask for the immediate reaction and adjudicate accordingly.
- Creatures within 5 feet of the edge of the pit must make a <u>DC 13 Dexterity saving throw</u>. They take 7d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- Creatures on the beam cannot dodge the flames unless they jump off. Otherwise, they automatically take 7d6 fire damage. If they jump off, they can stay ahead of the explosion.

>**Design notes**
>As you can see, most of this trap is actually pretty obvious. Its deadliness lies in the combination and whether or not the players figure out the logic. If you want to make this trap less harsh, add a bottom to the pit. In this way, the characters can just take more time to traverse it (triggering a wandering monster check while they are in a vulnerable position with lower elevation) using ropes or ladders.

#### Pit with invisible wall
> - The party approaches a **collapsed floor**, which looks like it can be jumped by anyone with a Strength score of 10+.
> - Ominous **growls** can be heard on the floor below, with **teeth and shining eyes** reflecting torchlight in the darkness.
> - Debris from the collapse lies on the floor below. It contains **odd cuboid indents**, as if someone pressed a brick into the rubble and then removed it.

**DM's Notes**
- The floor collapsed here because of the **invisible wall** blocking the hallway! Characters jumping will crash into it and fall (no save, 1d6 bludgeoning damage), left at the mercy of the creature(s) below.
- The indents are of course **invisible bricks** that fell of the invisible wall when the floor collapsed under it (remember, we <u>always</u> give *some* kind of hint).
- You can choose a**ny creature you prefer**, but make sure it is a tough fight for the PC's, especially when facing them alone! A good recommendation is Ghouls (MM 148), because their paralysis is especially scary when you are separated from the party. Don't forget to make them drag of the fallen sucker into the darkness!
- It is wise to include **some other hint** in the dungeon before they encounter this trap. Perhaps a mad scientists note lamenting how heavy everything becomes after applying his experimental invisibility procedure on them, or some invisible walls in a harmless "tutorial" context. Remember, assume competency; the characters are walking carefully, so they wouldn't hurt themselves on these invisible walls in the tutorial encounter. This doesn't apply when jumping off over a gap course ;).

>**Design notes**
>This trap relies completely on player skill. There is no way for a character to notice the invisible wall (unless it's already to late), and inattentive players are likely to ignore the throwaway line about indents in favor of discussing how to jump over the pit or defeat the creatures below. It is truly authentic misinformation. The player that tests this pit by throwing a rock across it will feel very clever indeed.

#### Dwarven Fear Trap
> - A **running dwarf** is carved out over the entrance of this hallway.

Three tripwire traps line this hallway.

>Each trap rolls a **Stealth +6 vs Passive Perception** (there is enough distance between the traps that the party will likely only notice one at a time)
>If the trap <font color = green>succeeds</font>, the party notices three thin horizontal grooves in the wall (about at feet, core and head height), with metal reflecting torchlight from within.
>If the trap <font color = red>fails</font>, the party notices three thin grooves in the wall, with metal reflecting torchlight from within. They also spot a thin tripwire spanning the floor.

Disarming the Tripwire with Thieves' Tools is a <u>DC 14 Dexterity</u> (Sleight of Hand) check, on a failure the process takes 10 minutes.

**Click-rule - tripping the tripwire**
A creature walking through the tripwire without realizing it is there hears wood creak and metal slide against stone. Ask for a reaction and adjudicate appropriately
 - Advantage - Jumping backwards, rolling forwards.
- Disadvantage - Making yourself small and stationary.

All other reactions prompt an single attack from the blades. 
>**Blades** Melee weapon attack: +6 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d8) slashing damage.

Three of these pretty obvious traps line the floor. 
After the second one --> **creatures with darkvision feel a <u>threatening magical presence</u> just beyond the edge of their vision.**
(Creatures without darkvision will feel the same after the last trap, just beyond their torchlight)

**DM's Notes**
- The tripwire traps are more of a decoy (they are easily disabled or just stepped over anyway).
- The real trap is an enchanted dwarven statue lurking in the darkness. Characters who see it must save or run away, likely triggering the traps in their panic!

If a creature continues on after this feeling and <u>see</u> the **Enchanted Dwarven Head Statue**, they must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw.
On a <font color = green>succes</font>, they are *frightened* for 1 minute.
On a <font color = red>failure</font>, they are *frightened* for 1 minute and also cannot resist the urge to flee the scene. Refer to 'tripping the tripwire' to adjudicate what happens when running back over the tripwires.

The hallway splits up around the dwarven head and then shortly rejoins a few meters after.

>**Design Notes**
>Another trap where most information is freely given, but the players need to be the ones who put two and two together. Notice how a skilled and careful rogue disabling all trip wires is a tremendous help here, but there are still many situations where they are not an instant-win button (for example, a character deciding to scout ahead alone might be in for a bad time!).

#### Paranoia Acid Trap
> - The party enters a **circular stone room**.
> - A strong **smell like vinegar** hangs in the room. \[Nature\] - This originates from a strong natural acid, capable of dissolving living creatures.
> - A **circular raised stone platform** dominates the center of the room.
>    - A firm **wooden chest** sits in the middle of the platform.
>    - **Arcane runes** circle the edges of the platform. They light up when a character gets closer. \[Arcana\] - The runes store a very powerful but controlled explosion.
>  - **Big stone slabs** radiate outwards from below the center platform, radiating outwards like leaves from a flower. They have very small gaps between them.

**DM's Notes**
- The **stone platform** is the only safe place in the room once the runes are triggered! It rests on a solid pillar in the center of the room.
- When the **runes** explode (they are triggered by stepping onto the platform), they 'cut of' the stone slabs that form the floor with a very precise explosion. They will then fall down into acid, there was no ground beneath them!
- The **gaps** between the slabs show only darkness below. Feeding sand or dust or something similar in them will reveal there is actually space beneath them.
- The **chest** is mundane. At the DM's discretion it can be locked, it might or might not contain treasure, it could be spiked into the floor etc...
- It is important that you keep track of where everyone is in the room at every moment! To make this subtle, simply ask everyone what they are doing first before adjudicating anything.

A <u>creature</u> stepping onto the central raised stone platform **triggers the runes**. They will start to glow brighter and more orange for a few seconds before exploding.

**Click-rule**
Describe the runes glowing and ask all for their immediate reaction.
- **Running towards the entrance**, a character will find themselves in the middle of the floor when the runes explode and it collapses. A creature takes 2d6 acid damage at the start of each turn while in the acid. Without external help, the character cannot climb out, as there are no handholds on the smooth stone walls. A merciful DM might grant a Charisma saving throw (DC 10) to determine whether or not the character is lucky enough to have one of the stone slabs as a temporary island.
- **Standing directly on the runes** prompts a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 1d6 force damage.
- A character **standing just besides the stone platform or the entrance** might grab on while falling. Apply the click-rule again and ask for a reaction when the floor collapses. A DC 15 Strength saving throw to hold on or a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw to jump to safety are the baseline.
- **Standing on the collapsing stone slabs** - Treat as running towards the entrance at the top of this list.
- Standing on the **stone platform or entrance**, a creature is fully safe.

>**Design Notes**
>Like most of the other examples, the 'trap' here is the party taking the most obvious action while ignoring subtle clues or thoroughly inquiring. We lead the players towards deadly assumptions while still leaving clues to what is behind the curtain for those who pay attention. In this case, the players will likely have their characters stand anywhere except inside the runes. Remember, if the players find some clever way of getting the heavy chest of the platform without physically stepping on it, they don't trigger the trap. In this case, they might leave thinking they 'won' while still being none the wiser about the nature of the trap. This too is part of designing traps, tricks and secrets; you must accept that some parties might not fully experience everything. If the party encounters the secret no matter what choice they make, it was never gonna be a secret in the first place.
