## Generic Minigames
### Rules
1) Determine target total.
	- Rolling (typically 4d6)
	- Mutual Agreement
	- Value chosen by DM

2) Participants roll to get as close as possible to the total in a limited amount of attempts, **without exceeding it**. Overshooting the target is an instant loss. 
	- The number of attempts allowed is typically a participant's proficiency bonus, with some exceptions. A participant can always roll at least one die.
	- Participants can roll any single conventional die between d4 and d20
	- Participants can choose to add or subtract a DM determined bonus to their die roll. A participant's total always increases by at least 1 after a die roll. (For example, Strength for Arm-Wrestling, Int for Chess, Charisma, Intelligence, or Wisdom for skill and bluff based card games, etc.)

3) Rounds, turn order, risk, and gambits
	- Each participant can choose to roll one die per round.
	- In the first round, the challenger goes first. If there is no clear challenger, the DM proposes an alternative way to determine who goes first.
	- The larger a die is,  the **riskier **it is. In later rounds, the participant who takes **the least risk** goes first. In the event of a tie, the order from the previous round is maintained.
	- The participant who took the largest risk can attempt a gambit instead of rolling a die. In the event of a tie for the greatest risk, no gambits are available.
		- Depending on the game certain gambits may not be available, or gambits not listed below may be available. 

#### *Gambits*
- **Sabotage.** Roll an opponent's die again, and choose which result they add to their total. If they modified their roll, they perform the same modification regardless of which result you force them to take.
- **Stabilise.** You may roll your next die twice and choose which roll you add to your total.
- **Undermine.** Decrease an opponent's total by d4.

### In play

Grom challenges Meeks to a bout of arm-wrestling.

The target of 16 is determined by rolling 4d6.

Grom has a constitution modifier of 3, and a strength modifier of 3. Grom can roll 3 dice of his choice, and add or subtract 3 from each result.
Meeks has a constitution modifier of 5, but a negative strength modifier. Meeks can roll 5 dice of his choice, but cannot use his negative modifier to change the outcome of a roll.

**round 1**
As the challenger, Grom goes first, and chooses to roll a d12. He rolls a 3, to which he chooses to add his strength modifier. His total is now 6.
Meeks opts to play it safe, and rolls a d4. He rolls a 1.

**round 2**
As the participant who took the least risk, Meeks goes first. He chooses to roll a d12. He adds 3 to his total, which is now 4.
Grom goes next and chooses to roll a d4. He rolls a 4, and adds that to his total, which is now 10.

**round 3**
As the participant who took the least risk, Grom goes first. He chooses to roll d4. He rolls 3, which he increases by 3, his strength modifier. His total is now 16.
As the participant who took the greatest risk, Meeks can attempt a gambit. He chooses the sabotage gambit.

Grom rolls the d4 again, and rolls a 4, which Meeks chooses. Because he added his strength modifier to the previous result, he must do the same for his new result as well. His total is now **17** which means he has overshot the target, and lost the arm-wrestling bout.
