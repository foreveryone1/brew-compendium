All players compete with one another.

Players have a resource called Momentum (it could be named anything). They have the opportunity to build up Momentum by taking actions for X amount of rounds. Higher momentum increases your chances to win, but does not guarantee it.

For example, the GM might present prepared obstacles with a set difficulty. The players describe how their characters attempt to overcome the obstacle. Based on their description, the GM grants a bonus or advantage to the roll to one player and a penalty or disadvantage to the roll to another player (in this case, one player always receives an advantage and one player always receives a disadvantage. Better make that description "good", whatever that might mean at your table). Successful players increase their Momentum by one, or don't receive any momentum in the case of failure. You might optionally grant 2 Momentum or subtract 1 Momentum for games that have some kind of critical success or failure mechanic.

At the end of the X rounds, players write down a secret Commitment number. You want this number to be higher than the other players, but not so high that you will roll under it. All players reveal their secret Commitment number. Then, each player rolls 2d6+their Momentum. If they roll below their Commitment, they are out of the game. The winner is the person with the highest Commitment score while still rolling equal or above.

## Examples
Momentum = Flow & Commitment = Speed in a high octane street race. Failure at the end means you crash and burn because you went 2 fast and 2 furious.

Momentum = Skill & Commitment = Cool while trying to escape the hellbeasts in the dark of the dungeon. Failure at the end means that despite a possible skillful escape, you lost your cool and panicked, soon to be eaten by a hellbeast.

Momentum = Assessment & Commitment = Aggression in a tense duel, where as a gimmick your opponent will describe their feints and tricks as the obstacles (and vice versa).  If you accurately read your opponents skills, you can afford to be more aggressive in the final deadly strike (or make a desperate lunge anyway, and hope luck carries you through it).
